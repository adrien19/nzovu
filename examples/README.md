# Nzovu Examples

This directory contains demonstrations of how Nzovu can be integrated into different queue-based applications. Examples may use mocks or placeholders and are not production deployment templates.

## 📚 Available Examples

### 1. [Interview Evaluation Platform](./interview-platform/)

**Status**: 📝 In development

An interview evaluation application that exercises selected Nzovu workflows. Some application behavior, including activity tracking, analytics, notifications, and report storage, is mocked or represented by placeholders.

**Features Demonstrated**:

- ✅ Priority Queues (urgent vs standard evaluations)
- ✅ Scheduled Messages (business hours processing)
- ✅ Calendar Schedules (daily/weekly analytics reports)
- ✅ Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) & Retry Logic
- ✅ Schema Validation
- ✅ Multi-tenant Isolation
- ✅ Heartbeat & Lease Renewal
- ✅ Real-time Updates (SSE)

**Tech Stack**: Next.js 14, Go, SQLite, Clerk Auth, Tailwind CSS

**Use Case**: Learn how to build a complete queue-based application with frontend, backend, and worker services.
